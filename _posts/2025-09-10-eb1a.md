## My Immigration Story

I arrived in the USA on a J1 visa in August 2022 after joining Meta Research as a PostDoc in probabilistic machine learning. Just a couple of months after I started at Meta, tech layofffs began to hit the Bay Area. I realized that, with my J1 visa, I had very little protection against deportation in the case of mass layoffs and promptly switched to an O1 visa which I received in April 2023. Although, both H1B and O1 visas allow a 60 day window following job loss for the visa holder to transfer the visa to a new company, the green card would provide full protection against deportation in the case of job loss which seemed important given the economic climate in the Bay Area at the time.

As I began to research the application process, two options stood out, namely the EB1A and EB2-NIW category green cards. Both green cards waive the requirement of sponsorship from a US company, meaning my green card application would not be abandoned if I switched employer.
