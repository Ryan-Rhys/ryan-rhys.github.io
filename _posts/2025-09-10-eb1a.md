## My Immigration Story

I arrived in the USA on a J1 visa in August 2022 after joining Meta Research as a PostDoc in probabilistic machine learning. Just a couple of months after I started at Meta, tech layofffs began to hit the Bay Area. I realized that, with my J1 visa, I had very little protection against deportation in the case of mass layoffs and promptly switched to an O1 visa which I received in April 2023. Although, both H1B and O1 visas allow a 60 day window following job loss for the visa holder to transfer the visa to a new company, the green card would provide full protection against deportation in the case of job loss which seemed important given the economic climate in the Bay Area at the time.

As I began to research the application process, two options stood out, namely the EB1A and EB2-NIW category green cards. Both green cards waive the requirement of sponsorship from a US company, meaning my green card application would not be abandoned if I were to switch employer. I contacted two law firms, [Chen](https://www.chenimmigrationreview.com/) and [Ellis Porter](https://www.ellisporter.com/), recommended to me by [Sang Truong](https://ai.stanford.edu/~sttruong/), a good friend pursuing his PhD in machine learning at Stanford at the time. Both firms offered free appraisals for EB1A/EB2-NIW which I took advantage of. Both firms offered a no-win-no-fee agreement for the EB2-NIW but not for the EB1A citing a preparation time of 1-2 months at a cost of ca. $5000. It was about this time that I came across Razvan Marinescu's [excellent guide](https://razvanmarinescu.github.io/green-card-I-140/) on self-petitioning his EB1A green card without the help of immigration lawyers.

Having already gone through the O1A application process, I figured that it would be easiest, cheapest, and fastest to prepare the EB1A application myself. In particular, time was the most important factor for me in early 2023 due to the economic climate in the Bay Area.

## EB1A Criteria and Process

To meet the standard for the EB1A green card, the applicant needs to satisfy three out of eight criteria set forth [here](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-first-preference-eb-1). I ended up choosing four criteria:

1. Evidence of your authorship of scholarly articles in professional or major trade publications or other major media
2. Evidence that you have been asked to judge the work of others, either individually or on a panel
3. Evidence of your original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business-related contributions of major significance to the field
4. Evidence of published material about you in professional or major trade publications or other major media

I had already used the first three criteria above for my O1 visa application and added the fourth for good measure. Loosely speaking criteria 1 refers to works that you have published as an author or co-author. At the time of my application I had published ca. 25 papers with 1000+ citations and so I felt this was a straightforward criterion to satisfy. An interesting case to refer to with respect to this criterion is that of [Kazarian vs. USCIS](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/03/04/07-56774.pdf). In terms of the second criterion, I had completed some 50+ journal and conference reviews at the time of my application. Based on my colloquial experience of the third criterion, this is typically satisfied by obtaining letters of reference from experts in your field who can attest to your original contributions of major significance to your field. In the main petition it is important to draw quotes made by your referees in their letters of reference to attest to your original contributions. I decided to add the fourth criterion based on the fact that I had an [MIT Technology Review article](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/09/20/132929/this-picasso-painting-had-never-been-seen-before-until-a-neural-network-painted-it/) written about a paper I was involved in as well as an article on one of my papers in [Synced](https://syncedreview.com/2023/02/03/genius-or-subpar-ai-mathematician-new-study-questions-chatgpts-mathematical-capabilities/). I also included academic papers that had built on and cited my work. To date, however, I don't know which three of the four criteria I ended up satisfying...
