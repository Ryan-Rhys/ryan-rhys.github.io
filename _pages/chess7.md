I don't think this description would be complete without an actual chess game. Here's a game I played at the 2011 European Youth Chess Championship in Albena, Bulgaria. The game was in the 6th hour of play
and it looks like Black is close to achieving a draw as White will be unable to win the two Black pawns and even so Rook + Bishop vs. Rook is a theoretical draw. However, Black has just played
1...Rg7. Does White have any opportunity to win the game? Find the solution below!
