In 2012 I had my annus mirabilis, putting in my best chess performance ever at the 2012 Paris Championship where in 9 rounds I lost just a single game to 
Serbian Grandmaster [Aleksa Strikovic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksa_Strikovi%C4%87) (which happens to be the one pictured!). My tournament performance rating was ca. 2530 and I was also
fortunate to win the prize for the best junior! Although my performance was well above the threshold for an IM norm unfortunately I did not make it due to a technicality, the fact that I had played 7 French players
in 9 games. Another highlight of this tournament was my roommate Callum Kilpatrick getting an official warning from the tournament officials for wearing flip-flops to one of his games!
