1. Introduction  
   Welcome to ryanrhys.com (the “Site”). I (Ryan-Rhys Griffiths) believe in protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what personal data I collect, why I collect it, how I use it, and how you can contact me about it.

2. What Data I Collect  
   • Information you provide: if you use the Contact form or email me, I collect your name and email address.  
   • Automatically collected data: site usage logs (IP address, browser type, pages visited, timestamps).  
   • Cookies or similar technologies: I may use basic cookies and analytics tools such as Google Analytics to understand traffic.  

3. How I Use Your Data  
   • To respond to your messages.  
   • To understand how people use the site and improve the content and experience.  
   • For security, fraud detection, and compliance with applicable laws.  

4. Data Sharing & Disclosure  
   • I do *not* share personal data with third parties except:  
     – when required by law; or  
     – with service providers who help run the site (e.g., analytics, hosting providers), under contract.  

5. Data Retention  
   I’ll keep your email or contact messages until you ask me to delete them. Usage logs are retained indefinitely or as required by law.  

6. Your Rights  
   Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to view, correct, or delete your personal data.
