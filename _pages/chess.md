I am a former [British Junior Champion](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/aug/14/british-championship-second-third-place) (U18) and 4-time Irish Junior Champion (U14, U16, U18). I became a FIDE Master aged 17 and played board 3 on the Irish Men's Olympiad Team at the [2012 Istanbul Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40th_Chess_Olympiad). I hold 2 International Master norms both made in the year 2013 from the 4 Nation's Chess League (4NCL) and the 2013 Czech Open in Pardubice.
