Welcome to my [personal website](https://ryan-rhys.github.io/ryan__rhys/) and thank you for taking the time to visit!

**Overview**

I'm a Research Scientist working on AI in San Francisco. My current focus is on large reasoning models and in particular their capabilities in domains such as [mathematics](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/58168e8a92994655d6da3939e7cc0918-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf), [chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17238), and chess. Recently, after working in AI and machine learning for 12 years, I am becoming increasingly concerned about AI safety and the future of work.

Other topics that interest me include probabilistic machine learning and AI4Science. I have worked on these topics at [Meta](https://research.facebook.com/), [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://github.com/huawei-noah), [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en), and the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), where I did my PhD in the Theory of Condensed Matter Group at the [Cavendish Laboratory](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/). Prior to that I did my undergrad in chemical physics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

**Miscellaneous Facts**

- I have an [Erdos number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) of 4 ([Alexei Kornyshev](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UU6vixUAAAAJ&hl=en) -> [Abraham Nitzan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Nitzan) -> [Peter Salamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Salamon) -> [Paul Erdos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s) being one route) and a [Bacon number](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon_number) of 2 (Jeremey Paxman -> Colin Firth -> Kevin Bacon), making my [Erdos-Bacon number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Bacon_number) 6.

- In a previous life I played [chess](/ryan__rhys/chess/).

- In a previous life I liked to [quiz](/ryan__rhys/quiz/).

- In a current life I like to dance and I am the owner of a Bachata [dance](/ryan__rhys/dance/) company.

**Research Collaboration**

I receive a huge volume of emails and LinkedIn messages each day so please accept my apologies if I can't reply to yours! Nonetheless, I have bandwidth for a small number of research collaborations. If you think I may be a useful supervisor for your project please see the instructions in [contact](/ryan__rhys/contact/)!
