Welcome to my [personal website](https://ryan-rhys.github.io/ryan__rhys/) and thank you for taking the time to visit!

I'm a Research Scientist working on AI in San Francisco. My current focus is on large reasoning models and in particular their capabilities in domains such as [mathematics](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/58168e8a92994655d6da3939e7cc0918-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf), [chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17238), and chess. Other topics that interest me include probabilistic machine learning and AI4Science. I have worked on these topics at [Meta](https://research.facebook.com/), [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://github.com/huawei-noah), [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en), and the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), where I did my PhD in the Theory of Condensed Matter Group at the [Cavendish Laboratory](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/). Prior to that I did my undergrad in chemical physics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). 

In a previous life I played [chess](/ryan__rhys/chess/).

In another previous life I competed in quizzes [quiz](/ryan__rhys/quiz/).

I have enjoyed running for 16 years [running](/ryan__rhys/running/).

I am the owner of a Bachata dance company [dance](/ryan__rhys/dance/).
