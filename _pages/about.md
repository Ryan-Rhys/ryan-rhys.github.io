Welcome to my [personal website](https://ryan-rhys.github.io/ryan__rhys/) and thank you for taking the time to visit!

I'm a Research Scientist working on AI. My current focus is on large reasoning models and in particular their capabilities in domains such as [mathematics](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/58168e8a92994655d6da3939e7cc0918-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf), [chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17238), and chess. Other topics that interest me include probabilistic machine learning and AI4Science. I have worked on these topics at [Meta](https://research.facebook.com/), [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://github.com/huawei-noah), [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en), and the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), where I did my PhD in the Theory of Condensed Matter Group at the [Cavendish Laboratory](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/). Prior to that I did my undergrad in chemical physics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). 

[chess](chess/)

In a previous life I played [chess](https://ratings.fide.com/profile/2502054). I am a former [British Junior Champion](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/aug/14/british-championship-second-third-place) (U18) and 4-time Irish Junior Champion (U14, U16, U18). I became a FIDE Master aged 17 and played board 3 on the Irish Men's Olympiad Team at the [2012 Istanbul Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40th_Chess_Olympiad). I hold 2 International Master norms both made in the year 2013 from the 4 Nation's Chess League (4NCL) and the 2013 Czech Open in Pardubice.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
