I have been an avid runner since I was 16. I am very fortunate not to have sustained any major injuries so far! While I usually prefer to run alone, 
I enjoyed participating in the Hyde Park Relays in London (pictured). The [route](https://runabc.co.uk/hyde-park-relays) is stunning.

Please find me on Strava if you'd like to connect!
