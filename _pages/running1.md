I have been an avid runner since I was 16. I am very fortunate not to have sustained any major injuries so far! While I usually prefer to run alone, 
I enjoyed participating in the Hyde Park Relays in London (pictured). The [route](https://runabc.co.uk/hyde-park-relays) is stunning. While in Cambridge I endured waking up early to run some [park runs](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/coldhamscommon/results/26/). My 5k time has hovered around 17 minutes for many years, it would be nice to break the 17 minute barrier at some point!

Please find me on Strava if you'd like to connect!
