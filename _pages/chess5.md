In August 2012, I represented Ireland in the 2012 World Junior Chess Championship in Athens, Greece. Unfortunately, the Irish Chess Union could only afford to send a single player. Travelling alone, 
however, I managed to run into the Welsh, Scottish, and British delegations at Stansted Airport and ended up sharing a room with Welsh player Ashley Davis. I had a strong start to the tournament, beating
American Grandmaster [Conrad Holt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Holt) in the 2nd round and Italian Grandmaser [Axel Rombaldoni](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Rombaldoni) in the 5th round.
Despite holding my own, for some time the field eventually proved too strong. 
I suffered a string of losses to Peruvian Grandmaster [Jorge Cori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Cori), 
Dutch Grandmaster [Robin van Kampen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_van_Kampen), and Russian IM [Grigory Oparin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigoriy_Oparin). Despite this, I still had an
opportunity to make an IM norm by beating my former roomate Callum Kilpatrick (who had had a terrible start after bizarrely losing to a little kid in the first round!). Unfortunately I lost this game.
