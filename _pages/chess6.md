In September 2012 just before starting my undergrad at Imperial College London, I played on board 3 for the Irish Men's team at the 2012 chess Olympiad. After a first round walkover against
Sierra Leone (who had had difficulty travelling to the tournament) we were paired with Azerbaijan in the second round who counted SuperGMs Shakriyar Mamedyarov and Teimour Radjabov in their team.
After 6 hours of play against GM Rauf Mamedov, I had a winning position. At a critical juncture, however, I chose the safer of two "winning" continuations only to fall foul of a knight fork I had missed
which led to a draw. the Azeri coach Tukmakov (a former coach of Garry Kasparov) pointed out the other winning continuation to me after the game.
Nonetheless, the game was still mentioned in the US's [news roundup](https://www.uschesstrust.org/chess-olympiad-r2/). Towards the end of the tournament I contracted a horrendoues bout of food poisoning
that relegated me to the hotel room for the final round match against the Dominican Republic.
