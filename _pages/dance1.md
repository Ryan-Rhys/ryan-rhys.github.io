I began learning to dance Cross-Body Salsa and Bachata on the same day in 2018 at Wolfson College, Cambridge. After about a month I was converted to Cuban Salsa where Darwin College 
still has a great [scene](https://www.instagram.com/darwin_cuban_salsa/). In Cambridge I trained in Cuban Salsa with [Leandro Charanga](https://www.instagram.com/leandrocharanga/?hl=en) and Randy Despaigne (Havana Rakatan)
for 4 years and in Bachata with [Bryan Wong](https://www.instagram.com/w.bryan/), as well as the Bachata Obsesion team. After dancing in the Bay Area for 3 years I started 
[Bachata Lab](https://www.instagram.com/bachata_lab/) (pictured). The class structure is modelled after my classes in the UK with 3 levels (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced). We hold weekly classes and a social
every Friday at 1830 17th Street, San Francisco, CA 94103 from 8pm-1am. Come along!
