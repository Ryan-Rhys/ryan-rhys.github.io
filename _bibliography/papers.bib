  title={Mathematical capabilities of Chat{GPT}},

  abstract = {We investigate the mathematical capabilities of two versions of ChatGPT (released 9-January-2023 and 30-January-2023) and of GPT-4 by testing them on publicly available datasets, as well as hand-crafted ones, using a novel evaluation scheme. In contrast to formal mathematics, where large databases of formal proofs are available (e.g., mathlib, the Lean Mathematical Library), current datasets of natural-language mathematics used to benchmark language models either cover only elementary mathematics or are very small. We address this by publicly releasing two new datasets: GHOSTS and miniGHOSTS. These are the first natural-language datasets curated by working researchers in mathematics that (1) aim to cover graduate-level mathematics, (2) provide a holistic overview of the mathematical capabilities of language models, and (3) distinguish multiple dimensions of mathematical reasoning. These datasets test, by using 1636 human expert evaluations, whether ChatGPT and GPT-4 can be helpful assistants to professional mathematicians by emulating use cases that arise in the daily professional activities of mathematicians. We benchmark the models on a range of fine-grained performance metrics. For advanced mathematics, this is the most detailed evaluation effort to date. We find that ChatGPT and GPT-4 can be used most successfully as mathematical assistants for querying facts, acting as mathematical search engines and knowledge base interfaces. GPT-4 can additionally be used for undergraduate-level mathematics but fails on graduate-level difficulty. Contrary to many positive reports in the media about GPT-4 and ChatGPT's exam-solving abilities (a potential case of selection bias), their overall mathematical performance is well below the level of a graduate student. Hence, if you aim to use ChatGPT to pass a graduate-level math exam, you would be better off copying from your average peer!},

  abstract={Automatic Chemical Design is a framework for generating novel molecules with optimized properties. The original scheme, featuring Bayesian optimization over the latent space of a variational autoencoder, suffers from the pathology that it tends to produce invalid molecular structures. First, we demonstrate empirically that this pathology arises when the Bayesian optimization scheme queries latent space points far away from the data on which the variational autoencoder has been trained. Secondly, by reformulating the search procedure as a constrained Bayesian optimization problem, we show that the effects of this pathology can be mitigated, yielding marked improvements in the validity of the generated molecules. We posit that constrained Bayesian optimization is a good approach for solving this kind of training set mismatch in many generative tasks involving Bayesian optimization over the latent space of a variational autoencoder.}

  abstract = {In this work we rigorously analyse assumptions inherent to black-box optimisation hyper-parameter tuning tasks. Our results on the Bayesmark benchmark indicate that heteroscedasticity and non-stationarity pose significant challenges for black-box optimisers. Based on these findings, we propose a Heteroscedastic and Evolutionary Bayesian Optimisation solver (HEBO). HEBO performs non-linear input and output warping, admits exact marginal log-likelihood optimisation and is robust to the values of learned parameters. We demonstrate HEBO’s empirical efficacy on the NeurIPS 2020 Black-Box Optimisation challenge, where HEBO placed first. Upon further analysis, we observe that HEBO significantly outperforms existing black-box optimisers on 108 machine learning hyperparameter tuning tasks comprising the Bayesmark benchmark. Our findings indicate that the majority of hyper-parameter tuning tasks exhibit heteroscedasticity and non-stationarity, multiobjective acquisition ensembles with Pareto front solutions improve queried configurations, and robust acquisition maximisers afford empirical advantages relative to their non-robust counterparts. We hope these findings may serve as guiding principles for practitioners of Bayesian optimisation.},

  abstract={The visualization of data is indispensable in scientific research, from the early stages when human insight forms to the final step of communicating results. In computational physics, chemistry and materials science, it can be as simple as making a scatter plot or as straightforward as looking through the snapshots of atomic positions manually. However, as a result of the “big data” revolution, these conventional approaches are often inadequate. The widespread adoption of high-throughput computation for materials discovery and the associated community-wide repositories have given rise to data sets that contain an enormous number of compounds and atomic configurations. A typical data set contains thousands to millions of atomic structures, along with a diverse range of properties such as formation energies, band gaps, or bioactivities.It would thus be desirable to have a data-driven and automated framework for visualizing and analyzing such structural data sets. The key idea is to construct a low-dimensional representation of the data, which facilitates navigation, reveals underlying patterns, and helps to identify data points with unusual attributes. Such data-intensive maps, often employing machine learning methods, are appearing more and more frequently in the literature. However, to the wider community, it is not always transparent how these maps are made and how they should be interpreted. Furthermore, while these maps undoubtedly serve a decorative purpose in academic publications, it is not always apparent what extra information can be garnered from reading or making them.This Account attempts to answer such questions. We start with a concise summary of the theory of representing chemical environments, followed by the introduction of a simple yet practical conceptual approach for generating structure maps in a generic and automated manner. Such analysis and mapping is made nearly effortless by employing the newly developed software tool ASAP. To showcase the applicability to a wide variety of systems in chemistry and materials science, we provide several illustrative examples, including crystalline and amorphous materials, interfaces, and organic molecules. In these examples, the maps not only help to sift through large data sets but also reveal hidden patterns that could be easily missed using conventional analyses.The explosion in the amount of computed information in chemistry and materials science has made visualization into a science in itself. Not only have we benefited from exploiting these visualization methods in previous works, we also believe that the automated mapping of data sets will in turn stimulate further creativity and exploration, as well as ultimately feed back into future advances in the respective fields. }

  abstract={We consider the problem of adaptively placing sensors along an interval to detect stochastically-generated events. We present a new formulation of the problem as a continuum-armed bandit problem with feedback in the form of partial observations of realisations of an inhomogeneous Poisson process. We design a solution method by combining Thompson sampling with nonparametric inference via increasingly granular Bayesian histograms and derive an $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ bound on the Bayesian regret in $T$ rounds. This is coupled with the design of an efficent optimisation approach to select actions in polynomial time. In simulations we demonstrate our approach to have substantially lower and less variable regret than competitor algorithms.}

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
